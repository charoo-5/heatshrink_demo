heatshrink, a data compression/decompression library for embedded/real-time systems.

This is based on [LZSS], since it's particularly suitable for
compression in small amounts of memory.

For more information, see the [blog post] for an overview, and the
`heatshrink_encoder.h` / `heatshrink_decoder.h` header files for API
documentation.
